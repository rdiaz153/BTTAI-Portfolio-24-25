This repository is the final project for Break Through Tech AI @ UCLA program's summer Machine Learning Foundations course.

This project had us:

* Take a dataset from earlier in the summer
* Use any of the models that we had learned throughout the summer, which range from decision trees and all the way to convolutional neural networks.
* Preprocess, analyze and data engineer the dataset
* Build our model and assess its results.
